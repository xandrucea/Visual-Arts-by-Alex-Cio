# Visual-Arts-by-Alex-Cio
This repository contains experiments with Processing to create
audio reactive visual art. Each sketch can be opened with the
Processing IDE.

## Sketches

- **SoundGridRoom** â€“ A 3D room made of colored grids that respond to
  microphone input. Different frequency ranges of the incoming audio
  drive the displacement of each wall. Open the folder
  `processing/SoundGridRoom` in Processing and run the sketch.
