# Visual-Arts-by-Alex-Cio

A collection of Processing sketches showcasing minimal audio-reactive visuals.

## Sketches

1. **SoundGridVisualizer** – Stand in the middle of a 3D room whose colored walls, floor and ceiling are made of equalizer-like bars that react to microphone input.

Look in the `sketches/` directory for individual sketches and instructions.
=======
This repository contains experiments with Processing to create
audio reactive visual art. Each sketch can be opened with the
Processing IDE.

## Sketches

- **SoundGridRoom** – A 3D room made of colored grids that respond to
  microphone input. Different frequency ranges of the incoming audio
  drive the displacement of each wall. Open the folder
  `processing/SoundGridRoom` in Processing and run the sketch.
